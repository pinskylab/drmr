\title{Calculate the interval score}
\usage{
int_score(y, l, u, alpha)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{A numeric vector of observations.}

\item{l}{A numeric vector of lower bounds for the prediction intervals.}

\item{u}{A numeric vector of upper bounds for the prediction intervals.}

\item{alpha}{A numeric value specifying the significance level (e.g., 0.05
for a 95\% interval).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of interval scores.
}
\description{
This function calculates the interval score for a given set of
observations, lower and upper bounds, and alpha parameter.
}
\details{
The interval score is a proper scoring rule that measures the
accuracy of interval predictions. It takes into account both the coverage
and the width of the prediction interval. A lower score indicates a better
prediction.

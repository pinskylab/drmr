According LOOIC criteria, model without AR(1) term better fit.","code":"data <-   make_data(y = dat_train$dens, ## response variable: density             time = dat_train$year, ## vector of time points             site = dat_train$patch, ## vector of patches             n_ages = 8, ## number of age groups             .toggles = list(likelihood = 1))  ## checking the elements of the list: class(data) names(data) drm_1 <- drm_compiled$sample(data = data,                              iter_sampling = 400, ## number of samples after warmup                              iter_warmup = 400, ## number of warmup samples                              seed = 2025,                              chains = 4,                              parallel_chains = 4) data <-   make_data(y = dat_train$dens, ## response variable: density             time = dat_train$year, ## vector of time points             site = dat_train$patch, ## vector of patches             n_ages = 8, ## number of age groups             .toggles = list(likelihood = 1, time_ar = 1))  drm_2 <- drm_compiled$sample(data = data,                              iter_sampling = 400, ## number of samples after                                                   ## warmup                              iter_warmup = 400, ## number of warmup samples                              seed = 2025,                              chains = 4,                              parallel_chains = 4) fmat <-   system.file(\"fmat.rds\", package = \"drmr\") |>   readRDS()  years_all <- seq_len(NCOL(fmat)) years_train <- years_all[years_all < first_id_forecast] years_test  <- years_all[years_all >= first_id_forecast]  f_train <- fmat[, years_train] f_test  <- fmat[, years_test] data <-   make_data(y = dat_train$dens, ## response variable: density             time = dat_train$year, ## vector of time points             site = dat_train$patch, ## vector of patches             f_mort = f_train,             n_ages = NROW(f_train), ## number of age groups             .toggles = list(likelihood = 1, time_ar = 1))  drm_3 <- drm_compiled$sample(data = data,                              iter_sampling = 400, ## number of samples after                                                   ## warmup                              iter_warmup = 400,   ## number of warmup samples                              seed = 2025,                              chains = 4,                              parallel_chains = 4) map_name <- system.file(\"maps/sum_fl.shp\", package = \"drmr\")  polygons <- st_read(map_name)  ggplot() +   geom_sf(data = polygons,           color = 1,           fill = \"gray70\") +   theme_bw() adj_mat <- gen_adj(st_buffer(st_geometry(polygons),                              dist = 2500))  ## row-standardized matrix adj_mat <-   t(apply(adj_mat, 1, \\(x) x / (sum(x)))) data <-   make_data(y = dat_train$dens, ## response variable: density             time = dat_train$year, ## vector of time points             site = dat_train$patch, ## vector of patches             f_mort = f_train,             n_ages = NROW(f_train), ## number of age groups             adj_mat = adj_mat,             age_at_maturity = 3, ## age at which fish are able to move             .toggles = list(likelihood = 1, ## non-zero density pdf                             time_ar = 1, ## ar(1) for recruitment                             movement = 1)) ## turning movement on  drm_4 <- drm_compiled$sample(data = data,                              iter_sampling = 400, ## number of samples after                                                   ## warmup                              iter_warmup = 400,   ## number of warmup samples                              seed = 2025,                              chains = 4,                              parallel_chains = 4) avgs <- c(\"stemp\" = mean(dat_train$stemp),           \"btemp\" = mean(dat_train$btemp))  min_year <- dat_train$year |> min()  dat_train <- dat_train |>   mutate(stemp = stemp -
